# Project Cryptforge — first combat slice

Original portrait mobile auto-battler prototype. The authoritative project brief is in [docs](docs/00_README.md).

Open this folder as a Unity project using **6000.0.65f1**. Open `Assets/_Project/Scenes/Gameplay/Gameplay.unity`, choose a **9:16** Game view, and press **Play**. The Vanguard automatically lands five Sword hits, defeats the Grunt, and stops attacking. Stop and enter Play Mode again to repeat.

- [Setup, acceptance checks, test commands, and validation limits](docs/22_FIRST_COMBAT_VERIFICATION.md)
- [Successful Android build and Samsung device test](docs/23_ANDROID_DEVICE_VALIDATION.md)

Only the first combat slice is implemented. Rewards, upgrades, encounter progression, result/restart flow, and additional weapons/enemies are subsequent work.

Local checks from the repository root:

```powershell
pwsh -File Tools/Verify-Project.ps1
dotnet test Tools/CombatChecks/CombatChecks.csproj --configuration Release
```

The .NET check compiles and tests the actual engine-independent combat source. It does not validate Unity components, asset import, rendering, or Android builds.
