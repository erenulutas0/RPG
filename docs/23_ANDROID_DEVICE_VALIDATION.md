# Android device validation — passed first combat smoke test

Date: 2026-09-12. The user authorized building and running the prototype on their USB-connected phone.

## Delivered

- App: **Project Cryptforge**, package `com.cryptforge.prototype`.
- Device: Samsung SM-S911B, Android 16, ARM64, 1080x2340.
- APK: `E:/MobileGame/Builds/Android/Cryptforge-Prototype.apk`.
- APK size: **15,442,511 bytes** (development build, debug signing, ARM64/IL2CPP).
- SHA-256: `371B4FDA69FDE71272333C9943A3A4C992EB592F59AD07B0A7C62E84D8637324`.
- ADB installation returned `Success`. Activity `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity` launched successfully. The app was left open on the phone.

## Verified results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unity import and full compilation | Passed after correcting the package manifest |
| Unity EditMode tests | 26 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped |
| Unity PlayMode tests | 5 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped |
| Static metadata/scene references | 46 GUIDs and 32 scene objects/components resolved |
| Android build | Succeeded; Unity exited with code 0 |
| Portrait rendering on device | Hero, enemy, weapon, labels and health bars visible without overlap |
| Automatic combat | Live screenshot shows Grunt at 40/50 HP with one hit; later screenshot shows 0/50 with five hits |
| Enemy death | Enemy shape disappears and `Grunt defeated` appears |
| Stop after death | Hit count remains at five; hero remains at 100/100 HP |
| Background/resume | Backgrounded for three seconds during combat; returned to a living enemy at 20/50 HP and three hits, then finished at five without a catch-up kill |
| App log | Final app-process log contains no E/Unity entries or managed/fatal exceptions matching the checked patterns |

This is a short device smoke test. Sustained FPS, battery/thermal behavior, other devices, and alternate resolutions have not been profiled. Vulkan capability probing emitted Android hardware-buffer errors during initialization; rendering worked and no Unity error/crash was observed. The standard Unity splash appears briefly before gameplay.

## Local evidence

Ignored test artifacts under `TestResults/`:

- `editmode.xml`, `editmode.log`
- `playmode.xml`, `playmode.log`
- `android-build.log`
- `android-combat.png`: living Grunt at one hit
- `android-resume.png`: resumed combat at three hits
- `android-final.png`: defeated Grunt at five hits
- `android-final-logcat.txt`: app-process log from the final run

The APK and local test artifacts are intentionally ignored by Git. Unity-generated `ProjectSettings/` defaults and `Packages/packages-lock.json` are retained for reproducible project setup.

## Installed tooling and fixes

- Editor: `E:/Unity/Editors/6000.0.65f1/Editor/Unity.exe`. The actual Editor reports revision `a18e2220bd50`; Unity updated `ProjectVersion.txt` accordingly. The earlier hand-authored `f34bf41fecc5` revision was incorrect; the requested version number did not change.
- Android Build Support plus bundled OpenJDK 17, NDK r27c, SDK/platform tools, API 34/35/36 and CMake installed successfully.
- Unity CLI 1.0.0-beta.9 is available at `E:/UnitySetup/unity.exe`; account sign-in and Unity Personal licensing are active. Installation followed Unity's [CLI workflow](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/unity-cli/use-unity-cli).
- The first launcher failed from the desktop. A relative executable path, colocated verified CLI binary and CRLF batch file let the administrator prompt run. The user approved it. No Windows security settings were changed.
- The elevated main install omitted Android modules, so they were installed separately with `install-modules` and child modules enabled.
- Removed nonexistent `com.unity.modules.textrendering` dependency when real import detected it. Text rendering is provided by the Editor.
- Aligned Test Framework manifest with the Editor's effective built-in version **1.6.0** (NUnit **2.0.5**) and retained the generated lockfile.
- Added `Scripts/Editor/AndroidPrototypeBuild.cs` with an Editor-only assembly: development APK from enabled scenes, portrait, ARM64/IL2CPP, explicit build-failure reporting.

## License lapse and recovery (later on 2026-09-12)

Batch-mode runs exited with code 198 (`No valid Unity Editor license found`, `Access token is unavailable`). The account was restored with the Unity CLI: `E:/UnitySetup/unity.exe auth login` (browser sign-in by the user), then `unity license activate --personal --accept-eula` with the user's explicit consent to the Personal terms. `unity license status` now reports Unity Personal assigned. Run the Editor outside restricted sandboxes; it needs its AppData caches.

## Kill → XP slice on device (2026-09-12)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unity EditMode tests | 34 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped |
| Unity PlayMode tests | 6 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped |
| Static metadata/scene references | 53 GUIDs and 32 scene objects/components resolved |
| Android build | Succeeded; APK 19,017,824 bytes, SHA-256 `A675F306D09761C46A7E318CA154D37F9CAC6FDFB739A10D56D74A1510E7F2B0` |
| Install and cold launch | `Success`; activity launched in 748 ms |
| Combat, 5.7 s after launch | Grunt 20/50 HP, **Hits landed: 3**, **XP: 0** (`android-xp-combat.png`) |
| After death, 12.4 s | Grunt 0/50, **Grunt defeated**, **Hits landed: 5**, **XP: 10**, hero 100/100 (`android-xp-final.png`) |
| App log | 465 app-process lines in `android-xp-logcat.txt`; no E/Unity, exception or fatal matches |

The narrow grey shape at the right edge of the combat screenshot is the Samsung Edge panel handle, not game UI. This remains a short smoke test.

## Rebuild and launch

Close any Editor using this project, then run:

```powershell
& 'E:/Unity/Editors/6000.0.65f1/Editor/Unity.exe' -batchmode -quit -projectPath E:/MobileGame -buildTarget Android -executeMethod Cryptforge.Editor.AndroidPrototypeBuild.Build -logFile E:/MobileGame/TestResults/android-build.log
adb devices -l
adb install -r E:/MobileGame/Builds/Android/Cryptforge-Prototype.apk
adb shell am start -W -n com.cryptforge.prototype/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity
```

Select a specific device with `adb -s <serial>` if more than one is attached. The commands above assume exactly one authorized device. The existing first slice has no in-game restart button: fully close the app and reopen it to start a fresh fight, or use `adb shell am force-stop com.cryptforge.prototype` before launching it again.

The first combat slice and the kill → XP slice are running on the phone. Upgrade choices, additional encounters, floors and an in-game restart remain future slices.
