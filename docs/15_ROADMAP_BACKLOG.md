# Roadmap & Backlog

## Phase 0 — Pre-production (1–3 focused days)

Deliverables:
- vision agreed,
- portrait confirmed,
- core loop sketched,
- Unity project created,
- Git initialized,
- placeholder style chosen,
- analytics event plan documented.

Do NOT:
- create final hero roster,
- create 100 icons,
- build backend.

## Phase 1 — Mechanical prototype

### Must
- one scene,
- one hero,
- one enemy,
- auto-target,
- attack,
- HP/death,
- reward,
- upgrade choice,
- restart run.

### Then (order accepted 2026-09-12, see `24`)
- 3 enemy archetypes (done 2026-09-13: Grunt, Runner, Tank),
- floor 1: six-room template, one boss, result screen with cause of death (done 2026-09-13: Ember Halls, see `21`),
- floor 2: second modifier and scaling tier, Extract/Descend checkpoint (done 2026-09-13: Quicksilver Vaults with Cursed Gold, gold at risk, see `21`),
- the Forge meta layer with unlocks, two relics and local save (done 2026-09-13: Relic Forge with Second Wind and Counterweight, versioned JSON profile, see `21`),
- 3 weapon behaviors (owner choice 2026-09-13: packs of enemies first, then Sword cleave, Staff area damage and Daggers with crits, Staff and Daggers unlocked in the Forge; done 2026-09-13, see `21`),
- pause control (owner feedback 2026-09-13: a run starts at once and only choice panels or leaving the app pause it; done 2026-09-13: HUD pause button, pause on leaving the app, see `21`).

### Next (owner choice 2026-09-14; art direction and order in `19`)
- isometric arena: a floating platform with enemies spread in two dimensions, larger packs and a rebalance, placeholder visuals (part 1 done 2026-09-14: arena floor, packs walking in and the rebalance, see `21`; the platform visuals are next),
- a touch-aimed area ability with a cooldown,
- icon HUD: room pips, boss bar, buff icons with details on tap, bottom health and XP panel, damage numbers.

Exit:
5–10 minutes playable.

## Phase 2 — Fun prototype

Add:
- 10–20 upgrades,
- 3–5 meaningful synergies,
- better juice,
- result screen,
- basic meta reward,
- local save.

Test with humans.

Exit:
multiple testers voluntarily replay.

## Phase 3 — Vertical slice

Add:
- one coherent biome,
- one production hero,
- final-ish UI,
- SFX,
- one additional weapon/hero preview,
- onboarding,
- analytics,
- crash reporting,
- device optimization.

Exit:
looks like a real game in one slice.

## Phase 4 — Soft-launch MVP

Add only evidence-backed features:
- more content,
- optional offline reward,
- rewarded ad hooks,
- IAP hooks if justified,
- store assets,
- localization basics.

## Phase 5 — Growth

Only if metrics justify:
- more heroes,
- events,
- cloud save,
- remote config,
- seasonal content,
- advanced economy,
- backend services.

- restart/end-run.

### Day 5
