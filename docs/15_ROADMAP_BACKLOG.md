# Roadmap & Backlog

## Phase 0 — Pre-production (1–3 focused days)

Deliverables:
- vision agreed,
- portrait confirmed,
- core loop sketched,
- Unity project created,
- Git initialized,
- placeholder style chosen,
- analytics event plan documented.

Do NOT:
- create final hero roster,
- create 100 icons,
- build backend.

## Phase 1 — Mechanical prototype

### Must
- one scene,
- one hero,
- one enemy,
- auto-target,
- attack,
- HP/death,
- reward,
- upgrade choice,
- restart run.

### Then (order accepted 2026-09-12, see `24`)
- 3 enemy archetypes (done 2026-09-13: Grunt, Runner, Tank),
- floor 1: six-room template, one boss, result screen with cause of death (done 2026-09-13: Ember Halls, see `21`),
- floor 2: second modifier and scaling tier, Extract/Descend checkpoint (done 2026-09-13: Quicksilver Vaults with Cursed Gold, gold at risk, see `21`),
- the Forge meta layer with unlocks, two relics and local save (done 2026-09-13: Relic Forge with Second Wind and Counterweight, versioned JSON profile, see `21`),
- 3 weapon behaviors (owner choice 2026-09-13: packs of enemies first, then Sword cleave, Staff area damage and Daggers with crits, Staff and Daggers unlocked in the Forge; done 2026-09-13, see `21`),
- pause control (owner feedback 2026-09-13: a run starts at once and only choice panels or leaving the app pause it; done 2026-09-13: HUD pause button, pause on leaving the app, see `21`).

### Next (owner choice 2026-09-14; art direction and order in `19`)
- isometric arena: a floating platform with enemies spread in two dimensions, larger packs and a rebalance, placeholder visuals (done 2026-09-14 with placeholder visuals: arena floor, packs walking in, the rebalance, a floating platform and camera framing between the HUD blocks; then pixel-art placeholders drawn from code for the void, the platform, the hero, the enemies and the combat effects, see `21`),
- an area ability with a cooldown (done 2026-09-14 as the Forge Burst around the hero: one button, a floor ring, 20 damage in 2.5 units every 8 s, see `21`),
- a wider platform with a walkable hero (drag to move), packs from all four sides, chests on the floor and a camera that follows the hero (owner request 2026-09-14; done the same day, see `21`),
- icon HUD: room pips, boss bar, upgrade/relic badges and bottom health/XP panel (done 2026-09-16 with imported foundry UI and themed choice cards; full stat details through Pause; individual badge tap details still pending; damage numbers already existed),
- extend the foundry UI to result and Relic Forge menus (done 2026-09-16; reused frames, responsive card rows and explicit visual shop states; see `21`),
- a frame-time probe for device sessions (done 2026-09-15, see `21` and `23`),
- local telemetry for device sessions (owner's shared roadmap 2026-09-15, stage 1; done 2026-09-15: a bounded local JSON Lines event log with run, room, choice, currency and time events, no SDK or network, see `21`).

Exit:
5–10 minutes playable.

## Phase 2 — Fun prototype

Add:
- 10–20 upgrades,
- 3–5 meaningful synergies,
- better juice,
- result screen,
- basic meta reward,
- local save.

Test with humans.

Exit:
multiple testers voluntarily replay.

## Phase 3 — Vertical slice

Add:
- one coherent biome,
- one production hero,
- final-ish UI,
- SFX,
- one additional weapon/hero preview,
- onboarding,
- analytics (a local event log exists since 2026-09-15; no provider is chosen),
- crash reporting,
- device optimization.

Exit:
looks like a real game in one slice.

## Phase 4 — Soft-launch MVP

Add only evidence-backed features:
- more content,
- optional offline reward,
- rewarded ad hooks,
- IAP hooks if justified,
- store assets,
- localization basics.

## Phase 5 — Growth

Only if metrics justify:
- more heroes,
- events,
- cloud save,
- remote config,
- seasonal content,
- advanced economy,
- backend services.

## First 7 days

### Day 1
- create repo/project,
- set portrait,
- make bootstrap/gameplay scene,
- placeholder hero/enemy.

### Day 2
- health/damage/death,
- auto-target,
- attack cadence.

### Day 3
- rewards,
- upgrade selection,
- stat modifier system.

### Day 4
- rooms/waves,
- 3 enemy types,
- restart/end-run.

### Day 5
- 3 weapon behaviors,
- synergy prototype,
- combat juice.

### Day 6
- first external playtest,
- record confusion/drop-off,
- create art style board only.

### Day 7
- fix top issues,
- decide art direction,
- build production asset test for one hero.
